## 1. Dependency Injection:

Question: 

Explain the concept of dependency injection in FastAPI and how it aids in request handling.

Answer:

Dependency injection in FastAPI involves passing dependencies into functions or classes, aiding in managing and providing required dependencies during request handling.

```python
from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

def get_db_connection():
    # function to get database connection
    return "Connected to DB"

@app.get("/")
async def root(db: str = Depends(get_db_connection)):
    return {"message": db}
```

## 2. Async and Await:

Question:

What are the advantages of using async and await in FastAPI? How does it differ from synchronous execution?

Answer:

Async and await in FastAPI enable handling multiple requests concurrently without blocking, enhancing scalability compared to synchronous execution.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    async def some_async_operation():
        return "Async operation result"

    result = await some_async_operation()
    return {"message": result}
```

## 3. Pydantic Models:
Question:

Discuss the role of Pydantic models in FastAPI and their significance in request and response handling.

Answer:

Pydantic models define the structure and types of request and response data in FastAPI, handling serialization, deserialization, and validation.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str = None
    price: float
    tax: float = None

@app.post("/items/")
async def create_item(item: Item):
    return item
```

## 4. Type Hints:

Question:

How does FastAPI leverage type hints and how does it enhance the development process?

Answer:

FastAPI uses Python's type hinting system to improve code readability and automatic API documentation generation.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def root() -> dict:
    return {"message": "Hello, FastAPI!"}
```

## 5. API Design and Best Practices:

Question:

What principles and practices do you follow to design RESTful APIs using FastAPI?

Answer:

RESTful APIs in FastAPI follow principles such as resource naming, HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), use of proper status codes, statelessness, etc., to ensure a standardized and predictable API design.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/items/")
async def create_item():
    # Create a new item
    return {"message": "Item created successfully"}

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
async def get_item(item_id: int):
    # Retrieve item by ID
    return {"item_id": item_id, "name": "Sample Item"}
```

## 6. Security and Authentication:

Question:

Explain the steps to implement JWT-based authentication in FastAPI.

Answer:

Implementing JWT-based authentication in FastAPI involves using libraries like PyJWT to issue tokens, validate them, and handle user authentication based on token information.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException, status
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer

app = FastAPI()

oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl="token")

def verify_token(token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme)):
    # Function to verify JWT token
    if token != "fake-access-token":
        raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED, detail="Invalid token")
    return token

@app.get("/protected/")
async def protected_route(token: str = Depends(verify_token)):
    return {"message": "Access granted"}
```

## 7. Database Integration and ORM:

Question:

Compare and contrast SQLAlchemy and Tortoise-ORM in the context of FastAPI. When would you use one over the other?

Answer:

SQLAlchemy is a robust SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library, while Tortoise-ORM is an asyncio ORM for Python compatible with FastAPI. The choice depends on project requirements and familiarity.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from tortoise import Tortoise, fields
from tortoise.models import Model

app = FastAPI()

class Product(Model):
    id = fields.IntField(pk=True)
    name = fields.CharField(max_length=255)

async def initialize():
    await Tortoise.init(
        db_url='sqlite://db.sqlite3',
        modules={'models': ['__main__']}
    )
    await Tortoise.generate_schemas()

@app.on_event("startup")
async def startup_event():
    await initialize()

@app.post("/products/")
async def create_product(name: str):
    product_obj = await Product.create(name=name)
    return {"message": "Product created successfully"}
```

## 8. Testing and Quality Assurance:

Question:

How do you approach testing FastAPI applications? Describe your experience with unit testing and integration testing in FastAPI.

Answer:

Testing in FastAPI involves unit tests, integration tests using libraries like pytest, and endpoint tests to ensure the correctness of API behavior.

```python
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from myapp.main import app

client = TestClient(app)

def test_read_main():
    response = client.get("/")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == {"message": "Hello, FastAPI!"}
```

## 9. Deployment and DevOps:

Question:

Walk us through the deployment process of a FastAPI application onto Docker and Kubernetes.

Answer:

Deploying FastAPI apps on Docker and Kubernetes involves creating Docker images, defining Kubernetes manifests, deploying containers, and managing them in a Kubernetes cluster.

```shell
FROM tiangolo/uvicorn-gunicorn-fastapi:python3.9

COPY ./app /app
```

## 10. Performance Optimization:

Question:

Describe methods to optimize API performance in FastAPI, considering factors like caching, async I/O, and load balancing.

Answer:

Techniques include caching frequently accessed data, leveraging async I/O for non-blocking operations, and employing load balancing to distribute traffic.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, BackgroundTasks
import time

app = FastAPI()

def expensive_operation():
    # Simulating a costly operation
    time.sleep(5)

@app.get("/optimized/")
async def optimized_route(background_tasks: BackgroundTasks):
    background_tasks.add_task(expensive_operation)
    return {"message": "Operation started in the background"}
```

## 11. Troubleshooting and Debugging:

Question:

Explain your approach to debugging issues in FastAPI applications. How do you handle error logging and diagnostics?

Answer:

Debugging in FastAPI involves logging errors, using debugging tools like PyCharm, pdb, or integrated debugging in IDEs, and analyzing logs to identify and resolve issues.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/debug/")
async def debug_route():
    # Debugging code
    breakpoint()
    return {"message": "Debug route"}
```
